                        C++ is a powerful, versatile, and widely used programming language that has had a profound impact on the development of modern software systems. 
                        Originally developed as an extension of the C programming language, C++ introduces object-oriented programming (OOP) features, making it a hybrid language that supports both procedural and object-oriented paradigms. 
                        It is commonly employed in systems programming, game development, embedded systems, real-time applications, and more. Below is an in-depth exploration of the language's history, features, strengths, applications, and ecosystem.

                    <h1>History of C++</h1>
                    <p>
                        C++ was created by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs in 1979. Originally called "C with Classes," it was designed to enhance the capabilities of the C language by adding support for object-oriented programming while maintaining backward compatibility. 
                        The first official version of C++ was released in 1985, and since then, it has undergone significant evolution through multiple revisions, with the ISO standardization process playing a critical role. Some key milestones include:<br><br>

                        C++98: The first ISO standard for C++ (1998).<br>
                        C++03: Minor updates and bug fixes to C++98 (2003).<br>
                        C++11: A major revision introducing features like lambda expressions, smart pointers, move semantics, and the Standard Template Library (STL) improvements (2011).<br>
                        C++14, C++17, C++20, and C++23: Subsequent updates have introduced features like constexpr functions, structured bindings, modules, coroutines, and enhanced standard libraries.<br>
                    </p>
