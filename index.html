                            C++ is a high level, general purpose, object oriented programming language which is used for developing desktop applications,
                            video games and other complex applications. It's a lot to take in at once, so let's break it down step by step.<br><br>
                            
                            <i>"C++ is a high level language" but what does it mean?</i><br><br>

                            It basically means that the syntax(the methodology to write statements) are in a language which can be understood by people.<br>

                            <i>"C++ is a general purpose programming language"</i><br><br>

                            general purpose programming language implies that the language can be used to develop applications for variety of tasks.<br>

                            <i>"C++ is an object oriented"</i><br><br>

                            Object oriented languages are languages which support the use of classes and objects. Further information on the definition and the applications of classes and objects is provided in chapter.<br>
